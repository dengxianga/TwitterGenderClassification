\section{Project Overview}
\indent \indent In CIS 520 machine learing course final project, we developed a system for twitter users'  gender prediction (male/female) based on their tweets and profile images. We were provided with a training set of 4998 labeled training samples, each has 5000 word features, 7 pre-extracted image features and 30000 raw RGB image pixel features. The time constraint for the final model(s) initialization and prediction is 3 minutes and 10 minutes, respectively, for 5,000 test samples. Also, The submission size is limited to 50 Mb in the final checkpoint. Our full system, including 7 models on different feature sets achieved 92.42\% on test set. Our submitted model for the final competition, including 5 models, achieved an accuracy of  91.04\% on the validation set, ranked $6^{th}$ in a total of 60 teams. \par

In the following sections, we present the cross-validation accuracies of each method we tried and discuss the rationale of our models. We also provide some interesting visualization such as the most predictive words and eigenfaces.
