\section{Discussion}
Working on this gender-classification project gave our team a chance reflected on what we have learned in class. Here is a short summary of things that have surprise us (or have taught us a lesson) 
\begin{itemize}
\item With different feature sets (especially they have various ranges and dimensions), feature selection and normalization have played an important role in improving the performances of our model. 
\item Last but not least, be careful with required formats..
\end{itemize}
